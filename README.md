# Banned Book Reviews - Fullstack App w/ User Login

I created a Banned Book Review website where a user can write a review on a book anonymously, all the while linking a PDF version to the book with the review. This goes into a public database that uses MongoDB, and the server is set up in Node.js, using Javascripy and EJS

**Link to project:** Coming Soon!
